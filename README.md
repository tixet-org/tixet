# Tixet - Decentralised, Fast and Feeless Open-Source Online Ticketing Platform

Tixet aims to transform the ticketing industry by introducing a decentralised, rapid, and cost-free open-source solution. Our platform seeks to dismantle the existing monopolistic structures created by centralized giants like Ticketmaster and Eventim, plagued by issues like excessive fees and lack of transparency. Tixet leverages the [IOTA](https://www.iota.org/) protocol and [OrbitDB](https://orbitdb.org/), moving away from traditional blockchain-based solutions, to offer an efficient, scalable and equitable ticketing experience.

## Features

- **Buy and Sell Tickets**: Tixet allows users to buy and sell tickets in a secure and transparent manner.

- **Create and List Events**: Tixet enables event organisers to create and list events on the platform.

- **Redeem Tickets**: Tixet allows users to redeem tickets via QR codes, ensuring a seamless experience.

## Benefits

- **Decentralisation**: Tixet empowers users by eliminating middlemen, resulting in direct and secure transactions.

- **Scalability**: Leveraging IOTA's Tangle technology, Tixet ensures seamless handling of high transaction volumes.

- **No Transaction Fees**: Tixet allows for feeless transactions, making ticket purchases more affordable.

- **Transparency**: The use of distributed ledger technology ensures full transparency and traceability.

- **User-friendly**: Tixet offers an intuitive user interface, designed to make ticket purchases as simple and seamless as possible.
